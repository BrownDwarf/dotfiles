# gully’s dotfiles

My fork of [Mathias's] dotfiles repo.  A few key differences:
- got rid of a lot of packages in Homebrew's `Brewfile` that I wasn't going to use
- tweaked the .osx file to comport with my preferences
- added a list of my conda environment.
- added many casks to the Brewfile.
- tweaked the bootstrap to limit how much crap is copied into the home directory.

The main virtue is having an *awesome* looking iTerm, with awesome aliases:

## Installation

**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!

## Original

I recommend forking the original version of this repo, but then learning from the changes I made.  My changes to the `Brewfile` might be interesting.
